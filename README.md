# Association-Rule-mining-for-predicting-null-values


This project takes a CSV file as input and creates a database in SQL Server using ODBC. Now it reads the null 
values one by one and then uses all the other given values to make association rules out of it to predict the null 
values. I have used C# as the programming language to make this code.
